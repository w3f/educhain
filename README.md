# OpenZeppelin Runtime Template for Substrate

Substrate has a steep learning curve. In order to make it easier for newcomers to get started, OpenZeppelin is providing a generic template that can be used to quickly bootstrap a Substrate project.

Along with the templates, OpenZeppelin also provides a documentation website that explains how to add or deduct all the common pallets to your Runtime project (including this template).
