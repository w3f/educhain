# Web3 Educhain

Educating Web3 through [Polkadot SDK.](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk)

## Why Educhain?

When creating [Web3 Educhain](https://github.com/w3f/educhain) project, there were around 50 parachains on the Polkadot network but no
concrete guides on launching a production-grade parachain and its maintenance. Also, there are very limited 
tutorials that demonstrate [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) features that are 
shipped with [FRAME](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame) library.
Web3 Educhain intends to address these issues.

## Why Polkadot?

Along with the efficient utility of coretime and blockspace, a parachain deployed on Polkadot has access to

- Multi-billion dollar security backed finality from block number one.
- Secure interoperability with multiple chains within and outside of the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Customizable blockchain runtimes written in Rust and executed as Wasm code.
- Decentralized network and networking stack with light-client prioritized design.
- Visionary, intellectual, smart (and at times oversmart) developer community. Welcome to the world of open-source development.
- Polkadot OpenGov and its Treasury, which pays [OECD grade salaries](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/#/membership) to the Technical Fellowship and funds numerous development initiatives through bounties.

With Agile Coretime, para chains can now produce blocks continuously or on demand. By activating Async Backing
feature, parachains can produce blocks every 6 seconds whose transactions get finalized in 20-60 seconds, and
around 800 TPS.
