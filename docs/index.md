# Web3 Educhain

Educating Web3 through [Polkadot SDK.](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk).

## Why Educhain?

When creating the [Web3 Educhain](https://github.com/w3f/educhain) project, there were around 50 parachains on the Polkadot network but no
concrete guides on launching and maintaining a production-grade parachain. There are also very limited 
tutorials that demonstrate the [Polkadot SDK](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/index.html) features that are 
shipped with [FRAME](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html) library.

Web3 Educhain intends to address these issues by providing a realtime, running example *with* documentation on how to replicate what achieve here.

## Why Polkadot?

Along with the efficient utility of coretime and blockspace, a parachain deployed on Polkadot has access to

- Multi-billion dollar crypto-economic security backed finality from block number one.
- Secure interoperability with multiple chains within and outside of the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Customizable blockchain runtimes written in Rust and executed as Wasm code.
- Decentralized network and networking stack with light-client prioritized design.
- Visionary, intellectual, smart (and at times oversmart) developer community.
- Polkadot OpenGov and its Treasury, which pays [OECD grade salaries](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/#/membership) to the Technical Fellowship and funds numerous development initiatives through bounties.

With Agile Coretime, parachains can now produce blocks continuously or on demand. By activating Async Backing, parachains can produce blocks every 6 seconds whose transactions get finalized in 20-60 seconds, and
[around 800 TPS](https://polkadot.network/blog/the-way-to-a-10x-throughput-lift-on-parachains/). 

With [elastic scaling](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/1829), the throughput of 
parachains is expected to improve further, with multiple cores being utilized at the same time. In the near future, parachains can subscribe to the parachains 
service of the [JAM chain](https://graypaper.com/), which enables advanced features that makes blockchain 
technology feasible for the majority of its use cases.
