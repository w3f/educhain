# Web3 Educhain

Educating Web3 through [Polkadot SDK.](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk)

## Why Educhain?

At the time of creating [Web3 Educhain](https://github.com/w3f/educhain) project, there were around 50 parachains on Polkadot network but no
concrete guides on launching a production grade parachain and its maintenance. Also, there are very limited 
tutorials that demonstrate [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) features that are 
shipped with [FRAME](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame) library. Through
Web3 Educhain, the Technical Education team at Web3 Foundation intends to address these issues.
