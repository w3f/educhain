# Sub0 Reset 2024 Workshop - Lauch your Appchain to Production

The journey of any production grade application always starts on a test network. Polkadot is privileged to have a high quality testnet: 
[Paseo Network](https://github.com/paseo-network), maintained by the community. Paseo network mirrors Polkadot and its system chain
runtimes, making it a play ground to test apps as well as appchains! 

## Tasks
